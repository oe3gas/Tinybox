"""The way to the TNC: a serial port or a TCP connection.

Both give the same small interface to tnc.py:
    await open()    raises OSError / serial errors when the TNC is not there
    write(data)     never blocks the event loop
    await read()    next chunk of bytes; raises ConnectionError when the link is gone
    close()

SerialTransport uses pyserial with one reader and one writer thread: at
9600 Bd a 300-byte write takes 0.3 s, which must not stall the asyncio loop.
Port settings as pk232py found them working on the PK-232 (P54.2): 8N1,
no XON/XOFF, no RTS/CTS, DTR and RTS asserted.

RTS/CTS (profile tm-d710, [tnc] rtscts = yes, 25.10.2026; reworked 26.10.2026):
the radio holds CTS low while its buffer is full. The port driver is asked to
stop on CTS (rtscts=True), but that alone is not enough - write() returns as
soon as the bytes are in the operating system's buffer (kilobytes), and some
USB adapters (PL2303 types, clones) keep sending their FIFO after CTS went low.
So kisshub does its own flow control as well: small pieces (CHUNK bytes), each
one pushed out of the port (flush) before CTS is checked again. At most one
piece plus the adapter's FIFO can overrun the radio instead of everything
queued in the driver.

A monitor thread samples CTS every CTS_POLL_SEC and counts every time the
radio takes it away (cts_drops, cts_low_s, cts_low_max_ms), with each change
in the DEBUG log - so the log shows whether the radio paces at all (the
TM-D700 never drops CTS in KISS mode, 26.10.2026). cts_waits / cts_wait_s
count only the times the writer itself had to wait.

A write that fails (unplugged adapter and the like) ends the port like a
failed read: read() raises ConnectionError and tnc.py reconnects - before,
the writer thread just ended and kisshub went silent on the air.

TcpTransport is for a TNC behind a network serial server (ser2net and the
like) and for the tests.
